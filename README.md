# credit-card-verify
takes card number, verifies if valid, and identifies credit card company

This program is used to check if a number is a valid credit card number. 
This program takes a user's input ("Number: "), assuming only one sequence of digits. No letters, spaces, or special characters.
It will check if the number given is the minimum length.
It also applies Luhn's Algorithm, a standard check for credit card number validity.
It will determine if the card is from either AMEX, Mastercard, or Visa.
If the number is valid, it will only output a company name. If it's not valid, it will simply say INVALID.
